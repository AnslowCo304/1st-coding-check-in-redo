            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Manhattan">Dr. Manhattan</a> would likely be able to cross over from the DC comics Universe to Marvel's, so him just randomly having coffee<br>with Marvel characters would be completely plausible.</li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Rider">Ghost Rider</a> can (somehow) just ride his motorcycle into space</li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Surfer">Silver Surfer</a> can travel through space and just stays out in it most of the time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With these facts about the Anti-Heroes, I imagine that the three Anti-Heroes shown above would schedule out times to just hang out on<br>a random planet and have coffee together, provided by Dr. Manhattan with his reality manipulation abilities.</p>
